    "text": "Access to affordable finance is one of the most pressing barriers limiting youth participation in agriculture in Nigeria. According to the EFInA 2020 survey, only 6% of youth aged 18–25 can access business loans. With agriculture employing about 35% of the workforce yet contributing less than 25% to GDP, it’s evident that underinvestment is a challenge.\nThis project aims to leverage data to bridge the finance gap and develop solutions that make agriculture more bankable and attractive for youth."
