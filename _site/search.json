    "text": "Post-harvest losses (PHL) are a critical barrier to food security, economic growth, and youth engagement in Nigeria’s agricultural sector. According to FMARD, 30–50% of perishable produce is lost annually due to inadequate storage, poor logistics, and weak market systems. This amounts to nearly $9 billion in annual losses (World Bank), equivalent to millions of missed meals and missed business opportunities.\nThis project explores how data-driven solutions can be used to predict, prevent, and reduce these losses — turning agriculture into a viable and attractive sector for Nigeria’s youth."
