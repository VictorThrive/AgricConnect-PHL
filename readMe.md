## Project Overview: Tackling Post-Harvest Losses in Nigeria

![](images/clipboard-2256623036.png){width="696"}

According to the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD), Nigeria loses between **30% to 50%** of its perishable agricultural produce annually due to poor storage, transportation, and processing infrastructure. The **World Bank** estimates that these losses cost Nigeria approximately **\$9 billion** every year â€” food that could otherwise feed millions and create profitable agribusiness opportunities.

### Key Statistics

-   **40%** of Nigeriaâ€™s total agricultural production is lost or wasted annually.

-   These losses:

    -   Consume **31% of total land** used for production.
    -   Contribute **5% of Nigeriaâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions**.
    -   Represent a staggering **9.1% of Nigeriaâ€™s GDP**.

-   Meanwhile, **44% of Nigerians are food insecure**, with the population projected to increase by **over 50% by 2050**.

### Insights from Loss Percentage and Price Data

An analysis of post-harvest loss percentages across Nigerian regions reveals:

-   **Kaduna (3.77%)** and **Katsina (3.75%)** experience the highest post-harvest losses, indicating systemic inefficiencies in handling and storage, likely due to infrastructural and logistical challenges.
-   **Ebonyi (3.23%)** and **Niger (3.23%)** follow closely with elevated loss rates.
-   Despite significant losses, Kaduna (â‚¦10,261 Million) and Katsina (â‚¦9,113 Million) show moderate average market prices, suggesting that factors beyond lossesâ€”such as market access, demand, and supply chainsâ€”heavily influence pricing dynamics.
-   **Benue State**, with a lower loss percentage (2.45%), does not feature in the top price brackets, reinforcing this complexity.
-   A notable outlier is **Sokoto**, with an exceptionally low average price of â‚¦146 Million, potentially due to oversupply, limited market access, or data anomalies.
-   Conversely, **Abia State** commands the highest average price, highlighting regional disparities in market dynamics.
