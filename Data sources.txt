According to the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD), Nigeria loses between 30% to 50% of its perishable agricultural produce annually due to poor storage, transportation, and processing infrastructure.
The World Bank estimates that these losses cost Nigeria about $9 billion annually — food that could feed millions and create profitable businesses.
